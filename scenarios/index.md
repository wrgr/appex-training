### Scenario 1: Investigating a Zoonotic Spillover Event

**The Problem:** A cluster of severe respiratory illnesses emerges in a rural community adjacent to newly deforested area. Goals: identify pathogen, find source, stop transmission.

**Interdisciplinary Approach:**
- **Ecologist + Biomedical Scientist**: Environmental investigation + genomic sequencing
- **Collaboration**: Compare human viral sequences with wildlife samples
- **Outcome**: 96% sequence match in displaced bat species enables targeted prevention

**Representative Research:** EEID program funding interdisciplinary pathogen transmission research


### Scenario 2: Countering Disinformation During Vaccine Rollout

**The Problem:** Vaccine hesitancy driven by online disinformation campaigns targeting specific communities.

**Interdisciplinary Approach:**
- **Information Access + Socio-behavioral + Biomedical**: Digital tracking + psychological analysis + scientific communication
- **Collaboration**: "Prebunking" with trusted messengers and culturally fluent messaging
- **Outcome**: Targeted approach more effective than generic fact-checking

**Representative Research:** Schillinger et al. (2020) SPHERE framework for social media health intervention
