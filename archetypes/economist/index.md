    <h4>Meet the Expert: <strong>Liz Jones</strong></h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Biotech Financier & Logistical Strategist</strong><br>
      A sharp, pragmatic venture capitalist who made her fortune funding cutting-edge biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Liz thinks in terms of systems, supply chains, and economic incentives. She is unsentimental and data-driven, initially clashing with the more idealistic members of the team. Her genius lies in her ability to see the global logistical and economic picture, and to manipulate those systems to achieve the team's goals, from acquiring resources to planning the global distribution of the cure.

### Overview

The economist analyzes **financial and resource impacts** of health crises using **macroeconomic modeling**, **distributional analysis**, and **cost-effectiveness frameworks**. This domain focuses on understanding **supply vs. demand shocks**, **inequality impacts**, **policy trade-offs**, and the complex interactions between health outcomes and economic systems.

### The Health-Economy Nexus

Pandemics create unprecedented economic disruptions with long-lasting consequences:

**Economic Shock Mechanisms:**
- **Supply-side disruptions** from workforce illness, death, and isolation requirements
- **Demand-side contractions** from reduced consumer spending and business investment
- **Financial market volatility** affecting credit availability and business continuity
- **Global supply chain fragmentation** disrupting production and trade networks

**Distributional Consequences:**
- **Sectoral asymmetries** with service industries facing disproportionate impacts
- **Labor market polarization** between essential and non-essential workers
- **Geographic disparities** between urban centers and rural communities
- **Intergenerational effects** on education, career development, and wealth accumulation

### Core Research Areas

**Macroeconomic Impact Assessment**
  - GDP contraction mechanisms and recovery pathway modeling using historical pandemic data
  - Labor market dynamics including unemployment, underemployment, and workforce participation changes
  - Inflation and deflation pressures from supply-demand imbalances and monetary policy responses
  - International trade disruptions and global economic integration effects on vulnerable economies

**Sectoral & Industry Analysis**
  - Healthcare industry capacity constraints, surge pricing, and investment patterns during crises
  - Tourism, hospitality, and entertainment industry collapse and recovery timeline analysis
  - Technology and digital transformation acceleration patterns and productivity implications
  - Essential services resilience analysis and supply chain vulnerability assessment across sectors

**Health Economics & Value Assessment**
  - Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) calculations for intervention prioritization
  - Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) for diagnostics, treatments, and prevention strategies
  - Value of Statistical Life calculations for policy analysis and resource allocation decisions
  - Health technology assessment frameworks incorporating uncertainty and equity considerations

**Public Finance & Resource Allocation**
  - Government spending priorities and budget reallocation decisions during health emergencies
  - Healthcare system financing mechanisms and insurance market stability under surge conditions
  - Social safety net program expansion, sustainability, and targeting effectiveness
  - Debt sustainability analysis and intergenerational equity considerations for crisis spending

**Inequality & Distributional Analysis**
  - Income and wealth distribution changes during and after health crises across demographic groups
  - Occupational and educational stratification effects on economic vulnerability and recovery
  - Geographic disparities in economic impact, policy support, and recovery trajectories
  - Intergenerational mobility and opportunity structure changes affecting long-term inequality

### Learning Objectives

By learning to embody this archetype, you will be able to:

1. **Differentiate supply-side vs. demand-side** pandemic economic shocks and their policy implications
2. **Model macroeconomic impacts** using standard frameworks and historical comparison data
3. **Conduct cost-effectiveness analysis** of public health interventions and policies
4. **Analyze distributional consequences** across different populations and geographic regions
5. **Evaluate fiscal and monetary policy** responses to health crisis economic disruptions
6. **Apply health economic evaluation** methods including QALYs and value-based assessments
7. **Forecast long-term structural changes** in labor markets, industries, and economic systems
8. **Integrate economic analysis** with epidemiological modeling for comprehensive policy guidance

### Key Challenges & Intersections

**üî¨ vs. Biomedical Scientists**
- **Challenge**: Modeling economic costs of long-term health consequences and chronic disease burden
- **Intersection**: How do we value health outcomes in economic terms while respecting human dignity?
- **Collaboration**: Health technology assessment combining clinical efficacy with economic efficiency

**üß† vs. Socio-behavioral Scientists**
- **Challenge**: Economic impacts of fear, uncertainty, and perception often exceed direct health effects
- **Intersection**: How do we model behavioral responses to economic incentives during health crises?
- **Collaboration**: Behavioral economics approaches to policy design and nudge interventions

**üèóÔ∏è vs. Built Environment Specialists**
- **Challenge**: Valuing ecosystem services and infrastructure investments for long-term pandemic prevention
- **Intersection**: How do we conduct cost-benefit analysis of preventive infrastructure and natural capital?
- **Collaboration**: Green stimulus policies that provide health, environmental, and economic co-benefits
