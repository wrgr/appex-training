  ## Core Research Areas

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Risk Perception & Decision-Making Psychology</h4>
  <p>Human behavior during pandemics is driven by how people perceive and process risk information. Socio-behavioral scientists study cognitive biases like the availability heuristic and optimism bias that affect health risk assessment, analyze how people make risk-benefit decisions under uncertainty, and examine cultural and demographic factors that shape risk perception patterns across different populations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Health Behavior Change & Intervention Design</h4>
  <p>Effective pandemic response requires understanding what motivates people to adopt protective behaviors. This involves applying established theories like the Health Belief Model to vaccination decisions, analyzing intention-action gaps using the Theory of Planned Behavior, building self-efficacy through Social Cognitive Theory approaches, and designing interventions using evidence-based behavior change techniques.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Social Networks & Influence Processes</h4>
  <p>Health behaviors spread through social networks much like infectious diseases. Scientists study how protective behaviors diffuse through interpersonal networks and community structures, identify opinion leaders who can influence community health responses, analyze how social media creates echo chambers that polarize health beliefs, and examine how social capital and collective efficacy enable coordinated community responses.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Trust, Communication & Health Equity</h4>
  <p>Institutional trust fundamentally shapes pandemic response effectiveness. This includes measuring factors that affect confidence in public health authorities, understanding medical mistrust patterns in historically marginalized communities, analyzing how stigma affects care-seeking and disclosure behaviors, and designing culturally appropriate communication strategies that address health disparities and differential vulnerability to misinformation.</p>

    <h4>Meet the Expert: <strong>Simone Dubois</strong></h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Behavioral Scientist & Communications Specialist</strong><br>
      A sociologist and psychologist from Sciences Po in Paris, Simone is a leading expert on mass psychology and the spread of information‚Äîand misinformation‚Äîin a crisis. She understands that a pandemic is fought on two fronts: the biological and the informational. Her work focuses on translating complex science into actionable public guidance. Empathetic and a brilliant communicator, she acts as the team's translator, bridging the gaps between the hard sciences and the human element.

## Overview

The socio-behavioral scientist explores **human thought, behavior, and social interaction patterns** that fundamentally influence disease transmission and public health response effectiveness. This domain incorporates health behavior theories, risk perception research, social network analysis, and communication psychology to understand why people make certain health-related decisions during crises.

Human behavior ultimately determines whether public health interventions succeed or fail, regardless of their biological or technical merit. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how psychological factors, social influences, and communication strategies can be as important as medical countermeasures in determining health outcomes.

## The Psychology of Pandemic Response

**Individual Decision-Making:** People don't respond to objective risk‚Äîthey respond to perceived risk, which is shaped by cognitive biases, personal experiences, and social influences. Understanding these processes helps explain why some people engage in social gatherings despite distancing recommendations, why protective behavior can be inconsistent due to risk perception biases, why misinformation sharing can undermine public health messaging, and why psychological reactance against perceived freedom restrictions can reduce compliance.

**Social Influence Networks:** Health behaviors spread through social networks much like infectious diseases themselves. This creates opportunities for positive influence through voluntary compliance that goes beyond mandates, peer influence that encourages protective behaviors, health-seeking behavior including vaccination uptake, and community cooperation in contact tracing and isolation measures.
