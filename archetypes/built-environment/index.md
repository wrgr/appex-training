    <h4>Meet the Expert: <strong>Bisma Khan</strong></h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Built Environment Engineer</strong><br>
	Dr. Bisma Khan (Urban Systems Expert): A brilliant engineer and network scientist who specializes in the intersection of infrastructure and epidemiology. After helping redesign health systems in New York, she became a leading consultant on how to make megacities more resilient to pandemics. Dr. Khan sees cities as complex systems and uses data to model how pathogens move through transit networks, buildings, and populations. She is calm, analytical, and focused on practical, structural solutions that can save millions of lives.

## Overview

The built environment specialist examines how the **physical design of human spaces**â€”from individual buildings to entire citiesâ€”influences disease transmission patterns and health outcomes. This domain focuses on **population density**, **housing quality**, **sanitation infrastructure**, **ventilation systems**, **transportation networks**, and **access to green space**. Urban design can either facilitate or inhibit pathogen spread, making this expertise crucial for pandemic preparedness and resilient city planning.

### The Built Environment-Health Connection

The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically highlighted how physical spaces affect health outcomes:

**High-Risk Environments:**
- **Crowded indoor spaces** with poor ventilation (meatpacking plants, nursing homes)
- **Dense housing** where isolation and distancing are impossible
- **Public transportation** systems with limited airflow
- **Buildings with outdated HVAC** systems that recirculate contaminated air

**Protective Environments:**
- **Well-ventilated buildings** with high air exchange rates
- **Outdoor spaces** and parks providing safe gathering areas  
- **Spacious housing** enabling quarantine and isolation
- **Walkable neighborhoods** reducing transit dependence

### Core Research Areas

**Building Design & Indoor Air Quality**
- Ventilation system design and airflow optimization
- Air filtration technologies and UV disinfection systems
- Natural ventilation strategies and window design
- Building envelope performance and airtightness
- Indoor environmental quality monitoring and control

**Urban Planning & Spatial Design**
- Population density effects on disease transmission
- Neighborhood design and walkability analysis
- Mixed-use development and activity patterns
- Public space design for social distancing
- Transit-oriented development and health implications

**Transportation & Mobility Systems**
- Public transit design and ventilation requirements
- Active transportation infrastructure (cycling, walking)
- Traffic management and air quality impacts
- Mobility patterns and disease spread modeling
- Transportation equity and access to healthcare

**Housing & Residential Environments**
- Housing quality and overcrowding effects on health
- Affordable housing design standards
- Neighborhood amenities and health services access
- Environmental justice and housing disparities
- Aging-in-place and universal design principles

**Green Infrastructure & Natural Systems**
- Parks and open space planning for public health
- Urban forest canopy and air quality benefits
- Stormwater management and vector control
- Ecosystem services and disease regulation
- Biophilic design and mental health benefits

### Learning Objectives

By completing this archetype, you will be able to:

1. **Analyze building ventilation systems** and their impact on airborne disease transmission
2. **Evaluate urban density effects** on disease spread, recognizing design quality matters more than quantity
3. **Assess transportation infrastructure** as vectors for disease transmission and health access
4. **Design public spaces** that promote health while enabling social connection
5. **Apply environmental justice frameworks** to identify and address health disparities
6. **Integrate green infrastructure** for multiple health and environmental benefits
7. **Conduct spatial analysis** to identify neighborhood-level health risks and assets
8. **Develop evidence-based recommendations** for healthy, resilient urban design

### Key Challenges & Intersections

**ðŸ’° vs. Economists**
- **Challenge**: Infrastructure upgrades are extremely expensive and require long-term financing
- **Intersection**: How do we balance upfront costs with long-term health and economic benefits?
- **Collaboration**: Cost-
