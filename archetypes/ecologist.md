  ## Core Research Areas

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Zoonotic Spillover & One Health Frameworks</h4>
  <p>Most pandemic threats originate from animal reservoirs, making ecological understanding essential for prevention. Ecologists study the complex pathways from wildlife maintenance hosts through bridge species to human populations, analyzing environmental factors that facilitate cross-species transmission. The "One Health" approach recognizes that human, animal, and environmental health are inseparable, requiring integrated monitoring and intervention strategies.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Biodiversity & Disease Regulation</h4>
  <p>Intact ecosystems provide natural protection against disease emergence through the "dilution effect," where higher biodiversity reduces pathogen transmission to humans. Ecologists investigate how host diversity impacts pathogen transmission networks, identify keystone species that maintain ecosystem health, and study how invasive species disrupt native host-pathogen relationships and community stability.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Land Use Change & Habitat Disruption</h4>
  <p>Human activities that fragment natural habitats create novel contact zones where spillover events are more likely. This includes studying deforestation and agricultural expansion impacts through habitat edge effects, analyzing how urbanization affects wildlife behavior and disease susceptibility, and understanding how infrastructure development creates new human-wildlife interfaces that facilitate pathogen transmission.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Climate Change & Environmental Drivers</h4>
  <p>Changing environmental conditions alter disease dynamics by affecting pathogen survival, vector distributions, and host behavior. Ecologists study temperature and precipitation effects on pathogen replication and transmission, track vector range expansion and seasonal activity shifts, analyze host migration changes that affect contact patterns, and assess how extreme weather events create spillover opportunities through ecological disruption.</p>

## Overview

The ecologist examines **organism-environment relationships** critical for understanding zoonotic disease emergence and spillover. This domain integrates wildlife population dynamics, biodiversity conservation, land use change impacts, and climate effects within the "One Health" paradigm that recognizes the interconnection of human, animal, and environmental health.

Approximately 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, originating from animal reservoirs before spilling over to human populations. Understanding these ecological processes is essential not just for responding to pandemics, but for preventing them in the first place through ecosystem-based approaches that protect both biodiversity and human health.

## The Ecological Origins of Pandemics

**Spillover Interfaces:** Disease emergence typically occurs at interfaces where human activities bring people into contact with wildlife carrying novel pathogens. These interfaces are created by habitat fragmentation that increases human-wildlife contact frequency, biodiversity loss that reduces natural pathogen regulation mechanisms, wildlife trade networks that create novel species mixing opportunities, and climate-driven range shifts that bring new hosts and vectors into contact.

**Natural Protection:** Intact ecosystems provide multiple layers of protection against disease emergence. These include wildlife corridors that maintain natural host population structures, protected areas that minimize human encroachment and disturbance, sustainable land use practices that balance development with conservation, and biodiversity buffers that maintain the dilution effect against spillover.
