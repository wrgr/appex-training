  ## Core Research Areas

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Building Design & Indoor Environmental Quality</h4>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how building design directly affects disease transmission through airborne pathogens. Specialists focus on ventilation system optimization for pathogen dilution and removal, air filtration technologies and UV disinfection systems, natural ventilation strategies that enhance air exchange, and indoor environmental quality monitoring systems that provide real-time health assessments.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Urban Planning & Spatial Health</h4>
  <p>City design influences health outcomes through complex interactions between population density, social infrastructure, and mobility patterns. This includes analyzing how neighborhood walkability promotes physical activity while reducing transit dependence, designing mixed-use developments that affect contact networks, and creating public spaces that enable social distancing while maintaining community connection and mental health.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Transportation & Mobility Systems</h4>
  <p>Transportation infrastructure serves as both a vector for disease transmission and a lifeline for healthcare access. Specialists study public transit ventilation requirements for reducing airborne transmission risk, design active transportation infrastructure that promotes health while reducing crowding, and ensure transportation equity so that mobility restrictions don't disproportionately affect vulnerable populations' access to healthcare.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Green Infrastructure & Environmental Health</h4>
  <p>Natural systems within urban environments provide multiple health benefits and pandemic resilience. This involves planning parks and open spaces for safe social interaction and mental health support, designing urban forest canopy for air quality benefits and temperature regulation, implementing stormwater management that reduces disease-carrying vector breeding sites, and incorporating biophilic design principles that support mental health through nature contact.</p>

    <h4>Meet the Expert: <strong>Dr. Bisma Khan</strong></h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Urban Systems Expert</strong><br>
      A brilliant engineer and network scientist who specializes in the intersection of infrastructure and epidemiology. After helping redesign health systems in New York, she became a leading consultant on how to make megacities more resilient to pandemics. Dr. Khan sees cities as complex systems and uses data to model how pathogens move through transit networks, buildings, and populations. She is calm, analytical, and focused on practical, structural solutions that can save millions of lives.

## Overview

The built environment specialist examines how the **physical design of human spaces**â€”from individual buildings to entire citiesâ€”influences disease transmission patterns and health outcomes. This domain focuses on population density effects, housing quality, sanitation infrastructure, ventilation systems, transportation networks, and access to green space as fundamental determinants of pandemic resilience.

Urban design can either facilitate or inhibit pathogen spread, making this expertise crucial for pandemic preparedness and resilient city planning. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically highlighted how physical spaces affect health outcomes, from crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation to well-designed outdoor areas that provided safe gathering opportunities.

## The Built Environment-Health Connection

**High-Risk Environments:** Certain physical characteristics consistently amplify disease transmission risk. These include crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation like meatpacking plants and nursing homes, dense housing where isolation and distancing are impossible, public transportation systems with limited airflow, and buildings with outdated HVAC systems that recirculate contaminated air.

**Protective Environments:** Conversely, well-designed spaces can significantly reduce transmission risk while supporting community health and well-being. These include well-ventilated buildings with high air exchange rates, outdoor spaces and parks that provide safe gathering areas, spacious housing that enables effective quarantine and isolation, and walkable neighborhoods that reduce dependence on crowded transit systems.
