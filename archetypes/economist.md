  ## Core Research Areas

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Macroeconomic Impact Assessment</h4>
  <p>Economists study how pandemics create both supply-side disruptions (from workforce illness and isolation) and demand-side contractions (from reduced consumer spending). This involves modeling GDP contraction mechanisms, analyzing labor market dynamics including unemployment patterns, and understanding how inflation and deflation pressures emerge from supply-demand imbalances.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Health Economics & Value Assessment</h4>
  <p>This field focuses on measuring health outcomes in economic terms through Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and calculating Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) for interventions. Economists help determine how to allocate limited resources by comparing the costs and benefits of different diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Inequality & Distributional Analysis</h4>
  <p>Pandemics don't affect everyone equally. Economists analyze how health crises impact different income groups, occupations, and geographic regions differently. This includes studying sectoral asymmetries where service industries face disproportionate impacts, and examining intergenerational effects on education and wealth accumulation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-area">
  <h4>Public Finance & Resource Allocation</h4>
  <p>During health emergencies, governments must rapidly reallocate budgets and expand social safety nets. Economists evaluate the sustainability of crisis spending, analyze healthcare system financing under surge conditions, and help design policies that balance immediate needs with long-term fiscal responsibility.</p>

    <h4>Meet the Expert: <strong>Liz Jones</strong></h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Biotech Financier & Logistical Strategist</strong><br>
      A sharp, pragmatic venture capitalist who made her fortune funding cutting-edge biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Liz thinks in terms of systems, supply chains, and economic incentives. She is unsentimental and data-driven, initially clashing with the more idealistic members of the team. Her genius lies in her ability to see the global logistical and economic picture, and to manipulate those systems to achieve the team's goals, from acquiring resources to planning the global distribution of the cure.

## Overview

The economist analyzes **financial and resource impacts** of health crises using macroeconomic modeling, distributional analysis, and cost-effectiveness frameworks. This domain focuses on understanding supply vs. demand shocks, inequality impacts, policy trade-offs, and the complex interactions between health outcomes and economic systems.

Pandemics create unprecedented economic disruptions with long-lasting consequences. While biomedical scientists focus on understanding pathogens and developing treatments, economists help society understand the broader financial implications and make informed decisions about resource allocation under uncertainty.

## The Health-Economy Nexus

Economic disruptions from pandemics often exceed the direct health impacts in both scale and duration. Understanding these economic dynamics is crucial because they influence everything from individual health-seeking behavior to global cooperation on pandemic response.

**Economic Shock Mechanisms:** Pandemics create supply-side disruptions through workforce illness and isolation requirements, while simultaneously causing demand-side contractions as consumers reduce spending and businesses postpone investments. Financial markets experience volatility that affects credit availability, and global supply chains fragment, disrupting production and trade networks.

**Distributional Consequences:** The economic impacts fall unevenly across society, with service industries typically facing disproportionate impacts compared to technology sectors. Essential workers face different risks than those who can work remotely, creating new forms of labor market polarization. Geographic disparities emerge between urban centers and rural communities, while intergenerational effects impact education, career development, and wealth accumulation for years after the acute health crisis ends.

## Key Challenges & Intersections

<div class="challenge-box">
<h4><span>üî¨</span> vs. Biomedical Scientists</h4>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Modeling economic costs of long-term health consequences and chronic disease burden requires translating health outcomes into economic terms while respecting human dignity.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Health technology assessment frameworks that combine clinical efficacy data with economic efficiency analysis to guide resource allocation decisions.</p>
</div>

<div class="challenge-box">
<h4><span>üß†</span> vs. Socio-behavioral Scientists</h4>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Economic impacts of fear, uncertainty, and perception often exceed direct health effects, requiring models that account for behavioral responses to economic incentives.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Behavioral economics approaches that incorporate psychological insights into policy design and use "nudge" interventions to improve outcomes.</p>
</div>

<div class="challenge-box">
<h4><span>üèóÔ∏è</span> vs. Built Environment Specialists</h4>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Valuing ecosystem services and infrastructure investments for long-term pandemic prevention requires new frameworks for cost-benefit analysis of natural capital.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Green stimulus policies that provide co-benefits for health, environmental protection, and economic recovery.</p>
